Incoming Associate Professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China.

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar Research Associate at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, working with [Prof. Mark Simons](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~simons/); and a member of the algorithm development team, led by [Dr. Heresh Fattahi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k8ocNo4AAAAJ&hl=en), for the Observational Products for End-users from Remote sensing Analysis ([OPERA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera)) project of NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

My long-term research objective is to better understand the surface response caused by tectonic, volcanic, and anthropogenic processes deforming the solid Earth and other planets. I am most interested in developing geodetic techniques to precisely measure the ground surface deformation to understand how and when it deforms with the present of geohazards. To this end, I am interested in the following research topics:

+ SAR / InSAR Algorithm and Tools Development
+ Geohazards from Active Volcanism and Tectonics
+ High Resolution InSAR Monitoring: Landslides and Infrastructures
