I am an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Geophysics at the Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Beijing, China. I am broadly interested in developing geodetic techniques to precisely measure the surface deformation and change, and to understand these surface responses caused by tectonic, volcanic and anthropogenic processes on Earth and other planets. My research interests include:

+ Space geodesy, particularly algorithm and tools for SAR and interferometric SAR
+ Active volcanoes and earthquakes
+ Infrastructure and landslides monitoring
