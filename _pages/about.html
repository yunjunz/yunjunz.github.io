<p>
Welcome! We are part of the National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging at the <a href="http://aircas.ac.cn/" class="hoverunderline">Aerospace Information Research Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.cas.cn/" class="hoverunderline">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> (AIRCAS). Our research covers the broad area of radar science, from satellite architecture design to signal processing technique development for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and interferometric SAR (InSAR), from natural hazards such as landslides and earthquakes to human-related phenomena such as city subsidence and infrastructure monitoring. Our recent topic of interest includes:

<ul>
  <li>SAR/InSAR algorithm and tools</li>
  <li>Big-data processing and analysis</li>
  <li>Satellite architecture</li>
  <li>Natural hazards</li>
</ul>
</p>

<b>Opportunities:</b> We are always looking for self-motivated PhD and master students to join our research group. Check the WeChat offcial account "空天院研究生会" for information on the annual winter, spring, summer and autumn camps, or contact me directly!
