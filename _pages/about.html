<p>
Welcome! We are part of the National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging at the <a href="http://aircas.ac.cn/" class="hoverunderline">Aerospace Information Research Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.cas.cn/" class="hoverunderline">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> (AIRCAS). Our research covers the broad area of radar science, from geodetic technique development such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and interferometric SAR (InSAR) to its applications on geological hazards, from tectonic and volcanic processes such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions to human-related phenomena such as land subsidence and infrastructure monitoring. Our recent topic of interest includes:

<ul>
  <li>Algorithm and tools development for SAR and InSAR</li>
  <li>Big-data processing and analysis</li>
  <li>Infrastructure monitoring</li>
  <li>Landslides, active volcanoes and earthquakes</li>
</ul>
</p>

<b>Opportunities:</b> We are always looking for self-motivated PhD and master students to join our research group. Check the WeChat offcial account "中科院空天院研究生院" for information on the annual winter, spring, summer and autumn camps, or contact me directly!
