## Co-seismic deformation of the 2021 Mw 7.4 Maduo earthquake in China [ [Zenodo]() ]

Co-seismic surface deformation of the 21 May 2021 earthquake in Maduo, Qinghai, China ([USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000e54r/executive)). These displacement products are derived from Sentinel-1 A/B SAR images from ascending track 99 and descending track 106, both acquired on 20 and 26 May 2021, using interferometry and speckle tracking techniques. Check [Xu et al. (2023, JGR)](https://yunjunz.github.io/files/Xu-2023-MaduoEQ.pdf) for more details.

## InSAR Time Series of Galápagos Volcanoes in Ecuador [ [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4743058) ]

Surface deformation history of the Galápagos volcanoes in Ecuador during 2007-2011 and 2014-2019 using InSAR time series analysis from ALOS and Sentinel-1 satellite. The dataset covers the 2008 eruption and 2017 dike intrusion at Cerro Azul volcano, the 2009 and 2017 eruptions at Fernandina volcano, the 2010 non-eruptive unrest at Alcedo volcano, the 2015 eruption at Wolf volcano, and the inflation prior to the 2018 eruption at Sierra Negra volcano. Check [Yunjun et al. (2019)](https://yunjunz.github.io/files/Yunjun_etal-2019-mintpy.pdf) for more details.
