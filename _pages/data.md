## 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes: Co-seismic deformation from Sentinel-1, LuTan-1 and ALOS-2 [ [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7877812) ]

Three dimensional co-seismic surface deformation of the 6 Feburary 2023 [M7.8](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000jllz/executive) and [M7.5](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000jlqa/executive) earthquake sequence across the Kahramanmaraş region near Nurdağı, Turkey. These displacement products are derived from Sentinel-1, LuTan-1 and ALOS-2 SAR images, using a combination of InSAR, multiple aperture interferometry (MAI) and speckle tracking. Check [Xu et al. (2023, CEE)](https://yunjunz.github.io/files/Xu-2023-TurkeyEQ.pdf) for more details.

## 2021 Maduo earthquake: Co-seismic deformation from Sentinel-1 [ [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7170328) ]

Three dimensional co-seismic surface deformation of the 21 May 2021 [M7.4](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000e54r/executive) earthquake in Maduo, Qinghai, China. These displacement products are derived from Sentinel-1 A/B SAR images from ascending track 99 and descending track 106, both acquired on 20 and 26 May 2021, using interferometry and speckle tracking techniques. Check [Xu et al. (2023, JGR)](https://yunjunz.github.io/files/Xu-2023-MaduoEQ.pdf) for more details.

## Kirishima volcanic complex: InSAR time series from ALOS and ALOS-2 [ [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4495797) ]

Surface deformation history of the [Kirishima volcanic complex](https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=282090) in Kyushu, Japan during 2006-2011 and 2014-2019 using InSAR time series analysis from ALOS and ALOS-2 satellite. The dataset covers the 2008, 2011, 2017 and 2018 eruptions at Shinmoe-dake and the 2018 eruption at Iwo-yama. Check [Yunjun et al. (2021, GRL)](https://yunjunz.github.io/files/Yunjun-2021-Kirishima.pdf) for more details.

## Galápagos volcanoes: InSAR time series from ALOS and Sentinel-1 [ [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3464190) ]

Surface deformation history of the Galápagos volcanoes in Ecuador during 2007-2011 and 2014-2019 using InSAR time series analysis from ALOS and Sentinel-1 satellite. The dataset covers the 2008 eruption and 2017 dike intrusion at Cerro Azul volcano, the 2009 and 2017 eruptions at Fernandina volcano, the 2010 non-eruptive unrest at Alcedo volcano, the 2015 eruption at Wolf volcano, and the inflation prior to the 2018 eruption at Sierra Negra volcano. Check [Yunjun et al. (2019, CAGEO)](https://yunjunz.github.io/files/Yunjun-2019-mintpy.pdf) and [Gregg et al. (2022, SciAdv)](https://yunjunz.github.io/files/Gregg-2022-forecast.pdf) for more details.
